An easy to use XML sitemap generator with support for image and video sitemaps for WordPress.

== Description ==
The [sitemap generator](https://www.marcobeierer.com/wordpress-plugins/sitemap-generator) uses an external service to crawl your website and create a XML sitemap of your website. The generator works thus for every plugin out of the box. The computation costs for your website is also very low because the crawler acts like a normal visitor, who visits all pages once.

= Features =
* Simple setup.
* Works out of the box with all WordPress plugins.
* Low computation costs for your webserver.

= Technical Features =
* Respects your robots.txt file (also the crawl-delay directive).
* Support for robots (noindex) meta elements.
* Adds nearly all indexable filetypes (for example .pdf, .xls, .doc) to the sitemap.
	* See https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35287 for a detailed list.

= Additional Technical Features for Paying Customers =
* Generation of image sitemaps.
	* Please note that URLs of linked images are also gathered and listed in the sitemaps generated by the free version. Just the support for embedded images (&lt;img&gt; elements) is reserved for paying customers.
* Generation of video sitemaps.
	* Currently only HTML5 video elements are supported.

= Upcoming Technical Features =
* Support for YouTube and Vimeo videos in video sitemaps.
* Support for HTML5 picture elements in image sitemaps.
* Automatic daily creation of sitemaps.

= Is the service free of charge? =
The sitemap generator service allows you to create a sitemap with up to 500 URLs for free. If your website has more URLs or you like to integrate an image or video sitemap, you could buy a token to create a sitemap with up to 50000 URLs at the following website. The wordpress plugin itself is free of charge, but nearly useless without the external service. Please note that also not indexable URLs (for example .zip files) count to the quota.

= Limitations =
By default the sitemap generator indexes the first 500 URLs of your website. If your website has more URLs, please see the section 'Is the service free of charge?'.

= Warnings =
If you already have an existing sitemap.xml in your WordPress root directory, this file would be overwritten. It is thus recommended to backup your existing sitemap.xml file before using the sitemap generator. I also have not tested the generator on Windows webspace. You should also access the sitemap.xml after the generation finished and check if everything is fine.

= Pre-Installation Verification Test =
If you like to test if the sitemap generator works fine with your website before you will install the plugin, you could use the [online sitemap generator](https://www.marcobeierer.com/tools/sitemap-generator#generator) on my website, which uses to same technology as the plugin to generate the sitemaps.  

== Installation ==
1. Upload the 'mb-sitemap-generator' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Access the generator with the "Sitemap Generator" button in the sidebar and use the "Generate your sitemap" button to start the generation process. The sitemap will be saved as sitemap.xml in your WordPress root directory. **Be aware that an existing sitemap.xml file would be overwritten without asking.**
4. Use the "Show the sitemap" button to download your sitemap and check if the generated sitemap is complete.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does the sitemap generator not index any URLs of my site? =

The sitemap generator is aware of robots (noindex) meta elements and does not list pages that a marked with the noindex attribute. I saw some websites in the wild, which have added the noindex attribute on each page. Please make sure that this is not the case for your website. Neither the sitemap generator nor a search engine will index your site if the noindex attribute is set globally.

= Is it possible to filter the URLs which are listed in the sitemap? =

The sitemap generator recognizes the noindex attribute if set on a page and respects your robots.txt file. It is thus possible to filter the results with these two mechanisms. A filter function in the plugin is not available, because it makes no sense in my opinion. If a page is not listed in a XML sitemap file, that means not that a search engine will not find it. Sooner or later the search engine finds and indexes the page. So the use of the noindex attribute and robots.txt are a clean solutions which is also respected by all serious search engines.
